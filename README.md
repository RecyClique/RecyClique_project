# RecyClique

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to connect and empower young individuals who are passionate about environmental preservation, by providing them with resources, information, and a platform to take action towards creating a cleaner and more sustainable world. Youth is our future, and we want our future to be clean and green. We believe young people have the motivation and the reason to fight for a more sustainable world, and what we want to deliver are resources to do just that.

## Who We Serve**

We aim to serve youth, as well as all individuals between young adults and the working class, who are environmentally conscious, eco-friendly, or aspire to be more so who live in any of the five boroughs of NYC. Our target audience includes academics, activists, and anyone who wants to make a positive impact on the environment, while connecting with their community in a fun way.

## Product Overview**

Our application RecyClique is a platform dedicated to fostering environmental activism through recycling-focused events. It empowers users to create or join events centered around recycling like clothing and item exchange or clean-ups, where participants come together to make a positive impact on the environment. By organizing or participating in these events, users earn special badges that showcase their commitment to sustainability on their profile page. We plan on keeping our users engaged through the events that bring them together with their community by giving a virtual incentive to revisit us such as badges/medals or updates to their user experience.

## Summary

The problem of plastic and carbon pollution, coupled with global warming, dirty oceans, tons of waste in landfills, and other crises, all impact life on Earth. This directly affects humans by compromising air quality, degrading ecosystems, and disrupting the delicate balance of our planet, leading to adverse health effects, loss of biodiversity, and increased vulnerability to extreme weather events. Recyclique is an application that aims to raise awareness about environmental issues and engage young individuals in the fight against rapid climate change. We do this by engaging people to work within their own communities. Some of the recycling-themed events our users can join are organized clean-ups, clothing swaps, furniture giveaways, and more. Through resource sharing, information dissemination, and community building, our app empowers users to make a difference and contribute to a cleaner and greener world. They are also able to browse the newest articles on global warming and the environment, as well as stay on top of the news in regards to what they can do to further their environmental activism.

## The Problem

The problem we aim to address is the widespread ignorance and lack of awareness regarding climate change, pollution, and the detrimental impact of industries such as the oil and gas, fish, meat, and dairy industries. This problem is prevalent in our communities and is often perpetuated by those who benefit from the public's lack of knowledge. New York is a city with millions of people, not enough space, and too much garbage. This is a problem that can only be solved by communities coming together to do their part in keeping our city clean. We want people to reduce, reuse, and recycle by making work fun. Young people often enjoy doing things with their friends and they can do this with the help of our platform by having a place where they can exchange items, get rid of trash, or join a group clean-up.

## Solution

Recyclique is a platform that tackles the challenges of limited community engagement and lack of awareness around recycling and environmental issues. It provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can connect, organize, and participate in recycling events while earning badges as a testament to their dedication. With educational resources, a curated news feed, Recyclique empowers users to make a positive impact, fostering a sense of community and promoting sustainable practices for a brighter future.

## Key Technical Challenges

- Data Integration: Integrating and aggregating data from various sources, such as recycling centers, environmental news platforms, and policy databases, to provide accurate and up-to-date information to users.
- EPA Envirofacts API and OpenAQ API: These APIs can provide environmental data that could be relevant for your users. For example, they could be used to inform users about the air quality in the area where an event is taking place.
- Earth911 Search API: This API provides information about recycling centers. This could potentially be used to help users find nearby recycling centers or to provide information about recycling options for different types of materials.
- GNews API and ContextualWeb News API: These APIs can be used to provide news articles related to environmental topics. This aligns with your goal of informing users about environmental issues and what they can do to help.
- OpenWeatherMap API: Weather data could be relevant for planning or participating in outdoor events, which seems to be a significant part of your app's functionality.

## Extension Opportunities

- Gamification: Introducing gamification elements, such as challenges, badges, and rewards, to incentivize users to engage more actively in environmental initiatives/events and recycling efforts.
- Partnerships with Businesses: Collaborating with local businesses and organizations to promote sustainable practices, offer exclusive discounts on eco-friendly products, and facilitate product exchange programs within communities.
